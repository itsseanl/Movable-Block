# Movable Block

This is a super simple custom gutenberg block that utilizes InnerBlocks as a wrapper in order to add click-and-drag functionality to any block.

Simply install and enable this plugin, then add the "Movable" block, and add a block within.

A minimal example of the underlying javascript is available to view on [codepen](https://codepen.io/itsseanl/pen/MYWQVJy)
